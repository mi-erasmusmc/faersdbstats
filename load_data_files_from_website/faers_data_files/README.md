In this folder we store the 'current' quarterly fda fears data files.

Whilst they are publicly accessible and are not small, slow connection speed to the fda pages makes downloading all
these files each time a bit of a pain.

If for whatever reason you do not wish to store the files, use a script like `download_legacy_files_from_faers.sh` to
download them.
